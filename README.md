## Simulator for object floating in fluid implemented with particle-based methods

Based on Saeed Mahani project (https://github.com/saeedmahani/SPH-3D-Fluid-Simulation/)

## Controls ##

a -- Toggle the physics animation on/off (upon starting animation is OFF)  
1 -- Load the "Dam Break" scenario (initial scenario)  
2 -- Load the "Cube" scenario  
3 -- Load the "Faucet" scenario  
t -- Toggle transparency of water particles
T -- Toggle tumble mode on/off (the water will react to the tilt of the camera)  
h -- Toggle visibility of the water particles, which are not on the surface

##### Advanced Controls #####

g -- Toggle grid visible (grid used for neighbor particle optimization)  
/ -- Toggle gravity on/off  
f -- Output current FPS to stdout
