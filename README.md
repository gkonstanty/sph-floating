## Simulator for object floating in fluid implemented with particle-based methods

Based on Saeed Mahani project (https://github.com/saeedmahani/SPH-3D-Fluid-Simulation/)

## Controls ##

Key | Description
:---:|------------
a | Toggle the physics animation on/off (upon starting animation is OFF)  
"space" | step
t | Toggle transparency of water particles
T | Toggle tumble mode on/off (the water will react to the tilt of the camera)  
h | Toggle visibility of the water particles, which are not on the surface
g | Toggle grid visible (grid used for neighbor particle optimization)  
/ | Toggle gravity on/off  
|
1 | Load the "Dam Break" scenario (initial scenario)  
2 | Load the "Cube" scenario  
3 | Load the "Faucet" scenario  
q | quit
